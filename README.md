Optimizations on LZW for Chinese text compression in JAVA.

This is an impressive compression tool for Chinese texts with GBK (it can support English with ASCII). I adapted methods from some paper many years ago and achieved all details. The new tool is targeted at Chinese, and it will learn and store in the dictionary combinations of Chinese characters, like phrases, through reading the contexts before. And I only use one-time compression with the variation of **LZW** in this project, while some other tools like ZIP always compress several times.
While you may find it less helpful because we now need universal tools, not ones with limited functions, furthermore, we now have NLP techniques, with which we can make it more adaptive and achieve better performance. However, it is still an effective way to show some basic principles could work well.

 

It is now not translated into English, so still in Chinese.
You can preview the code first and see the pictures of the report if you like.
